## Project Development Process

### 1. UI/UX Design
- Created a hero banner design using Figma.  
- Exported the banner as an image and imported it into the project.  
- Applied a 3-second animation to the banner for a smooth zoom and move effect.  
- Focused on clean layout, spacing, and hierarchy for better user experience.

### 2. Front-End Development
- Implemented React functional components for modularity:  
  - Hero  
  - Products  
  - Category  
  - Navbar, Footer, etc.
- Linked products to their category pages dynamically using React Router.  
- Imported all assets (images) into a centralized assets.js file for easy management.  
- Made the entire site fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile using media queries.  
- Added animations for hero banner and smooth transitions for content.
